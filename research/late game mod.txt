MM8BDM v6 buffed drastically the 100 to 0 HP speed ; closing games much faster ; most weapons can kill in less than 2 seconds if not missing.
Some DPS in v6 (damage output only, ignoring hitboxes, damage type, side effects etc)
Bubble : 125
Crystal (big) : 43
Wave : 115
freeze : 60
TBolt : 51
Spring : 109

> This v6 change makes DM more healthy as higher damage means your effort are less likely to be redeemed by a fragstealer.
Xover's purpose is to allow the use of even stronger weapons, but with certain conditions.

1+ Xover weapons are stronger than vanilla
2+ Xover weapons consume ammo equally from their ingredients, requiring less management, indirectly being more useful
3+/- Xover weapons require 2 weapons for one XW. While you have less weapons, 8 average weapons might be less useful than 4 more useful ones. Plus you don't need 50 weapons. You can focus on effective attacks rather than plenty of different, weak ones.
4- They need screws.
5- Cost a little bit of time to combine.
6- 2 weapons must be collected before entering xw mode. 1 weapon is needed to benefit from vanilla power.
  
  
  The issue is that XW weapons might not be worth investing conditions into in the current game state for the reward they give.
  In the current DM state, you might be better off picking the first weapon you find and spam random enemies with it. Low investment, decent kill potential.
  
  Two possibilities :
	> Reduce XW requirements
	> Improve XW reward
	
	> XW reward ? 
		1) > XW Weapon balance is more OP than vanilla
				> Higher damage
				> Better hitbox
				> Better/ slower speed (depending on projectile type)
				> better CC
				> better in general!!
		2) > XW ammo cost being shared amongs ingredients mean they have a larger ammo capacity before running out. That ammo uses several bars, though, holding too much weapons 
			can be actually harder to navigate through. 			Combining can help you maintaining a small, different enough set of weapons (maybe 2 to 4 weapons i.e, instead of holding 8+ weapons)
		It's basically combine what you don't want to keep!
		3) On death, you respawn with each XW's ingredients instead of losing them.
			> 2D becomes vanilla ingredients
			> 3D becomes the vanilla + the 2D, or two TD
			> 1D are destroyed
			> This encourages few stronger weapons rather than many lowD weapons. Each downgraded ND weapon on death is a no-screw-refund ; so the more weapons are downgraded,
					the more screws are lost. 1 5D weapon is more advantaged than 3 2D weapons here.
					> How are chains affected?
						> Chains are meant to reduce screw cost on long fusion chains.
							> Fusion chain size
							> Fusion initial level
							> (StartLevel * 100) / (2^(chainSize-1))
							> StartLevel = [1.0, 2.5]
							> ChainSize = number of elements in the fusion
						> Though initial price also increases depending on initial fusion level for two reasons :
							> Lots of low ND weapons are more vulnerable to death as the n of them will get uncombined. If 5D uncombine is worth as much as 1D uncombine then plenty-of-weapons
							 gamestyle is penalized.
							 > Second reason is to soften someone's snowball. Someone dieing with a 5D going back to 4D is thus more penalized than a 2D going back to 1D.

	> XW requirements ?
		2 weapons are needed to combine. You need no weapon with mega buster and 1 with vanilla to play. So an extra weapon is needed at least to go xover mode. 
		Though it's fairly common to pick up a few (3-4) weapons even in vanilla. Also sometimes you just find several weapons before finding an opponent, maps have lots of weapons.
		> To help with that in large servers, players drop a weapon on death
			...> What if we not lose everything on death? Depending on how xover-related were your actions with your current life?
		
		
		
FINAL DECISION : 
XW weapons are uncombined without refund and their ingredients given on respawn. Vanilla weapons are still destroyed.
Weapon fusion cost is now higher for higher tier initial ingredient ; each fusion chain does cost screws, but exponentially lower. Base cost decreased.
Players still drop a copy of a random weapon they owned on death.




TO DO NOT FORGET
COMBINING MUST STOP ON DEATH. IMMEDIATELY.
